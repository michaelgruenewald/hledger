cashflow

(cf)

This command displays a cashflow statement, showing the inflows and
outflows affecting "cash" (ie, liquid, easily convertible) assets.
Amounts are shown with normal positive sign, as in conventional
financial statements.

_FLAGS

This report shows accounts declared with the Cash type (see account
types). Or if no such accounts are declared, it shows accounts

-   under a top-level account named asset (case insensitive, plural
    allowed)
-   whose name contains some variation of cash, bank, checking or
    saving.

More precisely: all accounts matching this case insensitive regular
expression:

^assets?(:.+)?:(cash|bank|che(ck|que?)(ing)?|savings?|currentcash)(:|$)

and their subaccounts.

An example cashflow report:

$ hledger cashflow
Cashflow Statement

Cash flows:
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
--------------------
                 $-1

Total:
--------------------
                 $-1

This command is a higher-level variant of the balance command, and
supports many of that command's features, such as multi-period reports.
It is similar to
hledger balance assets not:fixed not:investment not:receivable, but with
smarter account detection.

This command also supports the output destination and output format
options The output formats supported are txt, csv, html, and
(experimental) json.
